This blog is a collection of ideas and practical tips that have helped me in my
daytime job as a software engineer. I share them in the hope of spreading the
knowledge and saving time for fellow engineers who encounter similar issues.

In addition, I use this blog as a place to distill my thoughts on current events
and my observations on the world around me.
